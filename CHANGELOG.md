* Linux/Unix daemon
 * Ensure that Icinga 2 does not leak file descriptors to executed commands.
 * There are 2 processes started instead of previously just one process.
* Windows client
 * Package bundles NSClient++ 0.5.0. ITL CheckCommands have been updated too.

 * Bugfixes for check plugins
* Cluster and API
 * Provide location information for objects and templates in the API
 * Improve log message for ignored config updates
 * Fix cluster resync problem with API created objects (hosts, downtimes, etc.)
 * Fix that API-created objects in a global zone are not synced to child endpoints
* Notifications
 * Several bugfixes for downtime, custom and flapping notifications
* New ITL CheckCommands: logstash, glusterfs, iostats
* Package builds require a compiler which supports C++11 features (gcc-c++ >= 4.7, clang++)
* DB IDO
 * Schema upgrade required (2.6.0.sql)
 * This update fixes timestamp columns required by Icinga Web 2 and might take a while. Please ensure to schedule a maintenance task for your database upgrade.
