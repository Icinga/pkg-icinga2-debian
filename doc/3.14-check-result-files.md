## Check Result Files

Icinga 1.x writes its check result files into a temporary spool directory
where it reads these check result files in a regular interval from.
While this is extremly inefficient in performance regards it has been
rendered useful for passing passive check results directly into Icinga 1.x
skipping the external command pipe.

Several clustered/distributed environments and check-aggregation addons
use that method. In order to support step-by-step migration of these
environments, Icinga 2 ships the `CheckResultReader` object.

There is no feature configuration available, but it must be defined
on-demand in your Icinga 2 objects configuration.

    object CheckResultReader "reader" {
      spool_dir = "/data/check-results"
    }
