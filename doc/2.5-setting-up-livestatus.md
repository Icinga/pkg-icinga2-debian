## Setting up Livestatus

The [MK Livestatus](http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html) project
implements a query protocol that lets users query their Icinga instance for
status information. It can also be used to send commands.

The Livestatus component that is distributed as part of Icinga 2 is a
re-implementation of the Livestatus protocol which is compatible with MK
Livestatus.

You can enable Livestatus using icinga2-enable-feature:

    # icinga2-enable-feature livestatus

After that you will have to restart Icinga 2:

    # /etc/init.d/icinga2 restart

By default the Livestatus socket is available in `/var/run/icinga2/cmd/livestatus`.

In order for queries and commands to work you will need to add your query user
(e.g. your web server) to the `icingacmd` group:

    # usermod -a -G icingacmd www-data

> **Note**
>
> Change "www-data" to the user you're using to run queries.
