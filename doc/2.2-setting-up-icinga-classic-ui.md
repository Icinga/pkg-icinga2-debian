## Setting up Icinga Classic UI

Icinga 2 can write `status.dat` and `objects.cache` files in the format that
is supported by the Icinga 1.x Classic UI. External commands (a.k.a. the
"command pipe") are also supported. It also supports writing Icinga 1.x
log files which are required for the reporting functionality in the Classic UI.

### Installing Icinga Classic UI

The Icinga package repository has both Debian and RPM packages. You can install
the Classic UI using the following packages:

  Distribution  | Packages
  --------------|---------------------
  Debian        | icinga2-classicui
  all others    | icinga2-classicui-config icinga-gui

> **Note**
>
> On all distributions other than Debian you may have to restart both your web
> server as well as Icinga 2 after installing the Classic UI package.

Verify that your Icinga 1.x Classic UI works by browsing to your Classic
UI installation URL:

  Distribution  | URL
  --------------|------------------------
  Debian        | [http://localhost/icinga](http://localhost/icinga2-classicui)
  all others    | [http://localhost/icinga](http://localhost/icinga)
