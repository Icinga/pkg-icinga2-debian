* [import](#template-imports) instead of `inherits` (examples in [localhost.conf](#localhost-conf))
* [apply](#apply) rules instead of inline definitions for [Service](#objecttype-service),
[Dependency](#objecttype-dependency), [Notification](#objecttype-notitifcation),
[ScheduledDowntime](#objecttype-scheduleddowntime) objects (examples in [localhost.conf](#localhost-conf)).

### What's New in Version 0.0.8

### What's New in Version 0.0.7

* DB IDO performance improvements on startup
* Fix notification_id handling in DB IDO
