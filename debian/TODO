icinga2 source TODOs
====================

* Replace embedded tools
  - doc/ strapdownjs and jquery

* Document embedded sources in tarball
  - third-party/

* icinga2 not a meta package
  - move default config to it
  - move service to it
  - to optimize dependencies

* dependencies
  - we should depend on /usr/bin/mail
  - and probably recommend mail-transport-agent

* IDO updates
  - can fail when the daemon is running
  - should properly disable/re-enable on updates

* IDO packages
  - mysql and pgsql should able to be installed at the same time
  - enabling the feature on first install does not work (debconf)
  - are features disabled properly on uninstall?
