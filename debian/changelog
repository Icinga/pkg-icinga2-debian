icinga2 (0.0.3-1~icingaorg+0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian packaging for the Icinga 2 alphas and betas
  * [dac8fa6] Imported Upstream version 0.0.3

  *** Please note that at this point Icinga 2 is highly experimental software
  *** and is missing a significant portion of the planned features. This
  *** is merely a technology preview and if you're planning to set up
  *** a production environment for Icinga you should use Icinga 1.x instead.
